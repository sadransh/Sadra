abstract: "The advancement of technology has enabled new functions and possibilities for prosthetic devices. This advancement has introduced additional complexities for the user of the prosthetic devices. The added complexities can actually force the user to use simpler passive prosthesis rather than more complex and more flexible ones. This paper discussed the various aspects of the FUM Bionic Hand-I, designed and built at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. It also discusses the various efforts placed to simplify the usage of this prosthesis by its user. The FUM Bionic Hand-I has 5 degrees of freedom and consists of several sub systems such as pattern learning glove, wireless EMG Signal transmitter, RFID system for identify objects and a rich graphical user interface (GUI). These features works simultaneously in order to minimize the users' efforts on control a prosthetics hand and makes the hand intelligent enough to cooperate with user. Finally, the paper discusses the force control capability of the hand in order to allow object grasping."
