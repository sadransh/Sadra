Unfortunately, At the moment, I am not allowed to upload related information on the latest robots I worked on. I will publish related photos as soon as I am allowed to do so.

## Background
------

The **FUM-Bionic Hand(*I, II, III*)** Robots are the result of Team members' efforts at the Advanced Robotics Lab at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. The main goal of these projects is to develop a bionic hand that aims to rehabilitate disabled people. On each project, different mechanical and electrical design concepts are tested and evaluated.

## My Contributions to these projects
------


As a junior Undergraduate Student at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, I joined the project. My first task was designing an implementing a new User Interaction( RFID ) for FUM Bionic Hand I. To this end, I experienced developing a part of C# GUI of the hand device. Implementing SPI and UART protocols and working with HC-05 and NXP RC-522 modules of STM32F4 series microcontrollers. My contribution leads to 2 papers DETECTING THE TYPE OF GRIPPING USING FUM BIONIC HAND BY RFID, SIMPLIFYING USER INTERACTION SOLUTIONS FOR THE FUM BIONIC HAND-I, and one patent. 

After the success of the first edition of the bionic hand, I continued my collaboration with the team. Two new mechanical designs started ( for testing different finger mechanisms ). A novel idea of getting feedback from muscles proposed by the team, and I was in charge of research and implementation of the concept. The exclusive characteristic of the idea is the reproduction of real defective muscle of the body by detecting movements through the movement of the magnet(s) which is(are) implanted inside the limb. My thesis was based on localizing and tracking magnets to emulate real body muscle movements.
