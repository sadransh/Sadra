**Soon results will be published in full detail.**

*	Experienced with State of the art Object Detection Deep CNNs. ranging from ResNets, to EfficientDet. 
* Hands-on with python, pytorch, and SOTA research platforms(e.g., detectron2 ...) 
* Implemented a family of modern, scalable and efficient damage detectors with AP50 53.6, F1-score 56.5 % and Inference Time 200 images/sec.
* familiar with different mechanisms to enhance the process of training and deploying a network (e.g. Auto-Augment, mixed precision training, ensemble methods, TTA, ...)
* Contributed to several Open-source GitHub repositories e.g. google/autoML, bbaug, ... .
