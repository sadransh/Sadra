Unfortunately, At the moment, I am not allowed to upload related information on the latest results. I will publish related videos as soon as I am allowed to do so.


* Experienced with ROS, MIT racecar platform, Intel Realsense Cameras, NVIDIA Jetson Boards(TX2, Nano).
* 3D reconstruction of areas with sparse features.
* Fusing different Odometry sources. ( IMU, Wheel Odometry, Stereo Vision on T265 )
* experienced different ROS tools e.g., RTABMAP, RVIZ, TF, etc.
